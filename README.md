# 🖼️ Image Steganography with Passcode Protection  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project demonstrates a simple **image steganography** technique using **Python** and **OpenCV** to hide confidential messages inside images. It allows users to **securely embed and retrieve messages** using a passcode-based mechanism.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔍 **Undetectable Message Hiding** – Stores text inside an image without noticeable changes.  
- 🔐 **Passcode Protection** – Ensures only authorized users can decrypt the message.  
- 🖼️ **Preserves Image Integrity** – The image remains visually unchanged after encryption.  
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast** – Simple implementation with minimal dependencies.  

---

## 📂 Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍 – Core language  
- **OpenCV (cv2)** 📸 – Image processing  
- **ASCII Encoding** 🔢 – Text-to-pixel conversion  
- **OS Module** 🖥️ – File operations
